My name is Larry and I currently live in Shoshone, Idaho. I was born and rasied in Logan, Utah. My family moved to Idaho nine years ago after a job loss. My wife and I have been married for twenty-one years and we have three children. I spend most of my free time working in the garden or tinkering in the garage.
